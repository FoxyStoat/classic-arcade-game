Project 4 - Front-End Nano Degree at Udacity

## Licensing

This is a project from Udacity here is the [repo link](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)

### How To Play The Game

Clone or download this repo to your local machine, unzip and then open the index.html file in your prefered browser.

Alternatively you can click this [link](https://foxystoat.github.io/classic-arcade-game/) to view a live demo hosted on GitHub pages.

Use the **arrow keys** on your keyboard to control the player.
The aim of the game is to navigate the character from the grass to the water and avoid all the bugs.

Your score will be updated if your player reaches the water, a gem is picked up and if a collision happens between player and a bug.


Need to update this section and also add screen shot of working game and a link to live demo once project is complete
